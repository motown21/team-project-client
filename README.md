## STORIES

### Story 1
I had an issue with index crud. I was able to join and work in a break out room where
my classmates helped me debugg and talked out the issue to my problem. We disscussed the issue and what i had already tried to do to solve it. They gave suggestions on what jquery method i should use to reslove my problem. I was apprehesive on which action to implement  to append to the string i had created to hold all teams. I read a lot of documentation and it still took a classmates help to see and understand exactly how the code was working. Looking  back at the sudeo code from lessons really help me add to my code and also understand the process.

### Story 2
Another issue i encounter was working in multiple terminals i stated to get confused on which programs were running and which calls to make for each app to run. So that caused some unnecessary issues with my browser. I need to pay more attention to that in the future

### Unsolved problem
I would like to show one team. I have get all teams  working but  showing one was creating problems for me.
it was brought to my attention that i have an older mongoDB that doesnt  reconize certain elements in my backend so that could be a reason why it wasnt showing in the browser.

I would also like to add more css to make a cleaners user interface.
